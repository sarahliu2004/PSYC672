\subsection{Descriptive statistics}
Descriptive statistics, including the mean and standard deviation of connectedness rating and contagion rating across two conditions of informing, are presented in Table \ref{tab:table1}. Together with Figure 5, when no names of laughter were given before listening to the recordings (i.e., uninformed condition), the social connectedness ratings predicted a linear relationship with the contagion rating. In contrast, when the name was given (i.e. informed condition), there was a boost effect for contagion ratings at lower social connectedness ratings.
